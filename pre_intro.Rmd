## Preamble
___

### The course material

The course material is open source, meaning that the source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.

* The source code for the course material is located at: https://github.com/fishvice/tcrenv2017
* The course product is rendered at: http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/education/tcrenv2017

### Typical science project

```{r out.width = "75%", fig.cap = "From: Grolemund and Wickham"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/data_science.png")
```

* Import
    * Import data stored in a file, database, or web API, and load it into R
* Tidy
    * Each column is a variable, and each row is an observation

```
“Tidy datasets are all alike but every messy dataset is messy in its own way.”
                                                            - Hadley Wickham
```

* Transform
    * Narrowing in on observations of interest
    * Creating new variables that are functions of existing variables
    * Calculating a set of summary statistics (like counts or means)
    * ...
* Visualize
    * May show unexpected things
    * May raise new questions about the data
    * A powerful communication platform
    * ...
* Model
    * Once questions made sufficiently precise, one can use a model to answer them
    * Model cannot question its own assumptions!
* Communicate
    * Presentation and documentation

### Our aim

Our aim in this short course is to:

* Get you up and running with importing, visualization and transformation of data.
* Introduce you to reproducible analysis and document writing.
* Introduce you to programming (functions and loops) and modelling.
* Get you a head start with analyzing your own data.

We are going to use a set of recently developed tools that fall under the **tidyverse** umbrella. These are basic set of **generic** tools that are integrated to work seamlessly with one another.

We believe that the tools introduced will get your quickly up and running with your own data, solving >50% of the most common tasks. Going through the [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) by Grolemund and Hadley (which serves as our basic template for some of course structure) will pick up additional 30+%.

## Getting started
___

For this course you need to have R (and Rtools), RStudio and a sweep of packages.

### R

#### What is R?

* R is command line driven programming language
    * its biggest appeal as one can reuse commands
    * its biggest hurdle in widespread use
* R is open-source:
    * Other statistical software packages can be extremely expensive
    * Large user base with almost all statistical methods implemented

#### Why R?

R has become the lingua franca of statistical analysis and data wrangling

* Its free! If you are a teacher or a student, the benefits are obvious
* It runs on a variety of platforms including Windows, Unix and MacOS
* It provides an unparalleled platform for programming new statistical
methods in an easy and straightforward manner
* It offers powerful tools for data exploration and presentation

#### Download R

* Latest version of __R__: see [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    * If your platform is Windows, also install [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools)

### RStudio

#### What is RStudio?

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com) allows the user to run R in a user-friendly IDE environment.
* It is open-source (i.e. free) and available at www.rstudio.com
* Built to help you write R code, run R code, and analyze data with R
* Text editor, project handling, markdown support, keyboard shortcuts, debugging tools, version control, ...

* Within RStudio one can achieve almost all that is needed to complete a typical science project

#### Download RStudio

* Latest version of __RStudio__: see [RStudio Desktop](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
    * If you are adventurous install the latest [developmental version](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/preview)

### Running R

#### Our environment - RStudio

A typical RStudio window may look something like this:
```{r out.width = "75%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/rstudio.png")
```

* **Console**: One can type R commands directly into the console to perform calculations
* **Script editor**: An R script is basically a series of stored R commands that can be run in the
console
    * To generate a new script do: New file -> R Script (ctrl-shift-N)
* **Environment**: Contains a list of all declared variables. If you have a dataset you can double click the variable to view the data.
* **History** Contains a list of previous commands entered into the console
* **Other items**:
    * Files: List of object in a directory
    * Plots: Graphical output from R. The user can export these the figures to file (as jpeg, png or pdf) or to clipboard
    * Help: Gives a brows-able interface to R’s in-line help pages. The user can search for a topic or a specific function
    
#### RStudio project

* RStudio allows us to make things a little bit easier by isolating various tasks within specific projects (**read**: directory/folder on your computer).
* Projects save the state between sessions. This includes:
    * Working directories
    * Open files/scripts
    * Workspaces
* One can have multiple RStudio projects open at any one time
    * The modern call for multitasking :-)
    
We strongly urge you to get into the habit of splitting your various tasks into specific RStudio projects.

<div class="panel panel-warning">
<div class="panel-heading">Hands on exercise - Projects and some basic R</div>
<div class="panel-body">

1. Open R-studio and create a new project: File -> New project ... -> New directory --> Empty project --> ...
2. Create a new R script: File -> New file -> R Script
3. Copy the content of [this code](http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/education/tcrenv2017/R/exercise1.R) into the R script.
3. Save the script, e.g. exercise1.R: File -> Save
4. We will run each line of code, observe, change, add, and most importantly learn while doing
5. Once you have gone through the whole script, try: File -> Compile Report ..., choosing the output according to your liking :-)

## Packages
___

### What are packages?

* Packages are a collection of functions and data with documentations.
* Numerous basic packages come with R but the strength of the R-environment comes from the huge amount of packages that are provided by third sources.

```{r out.width="75%"}
url <- "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/daroczig/3cf06d6db4be2bbe3368/raw/8e970fad675d443813be2c98c508e6224491495e/number-of-submitted-packages-to-CRAN.png"
knitr::include_graphics(url)
```

### Installing packages

We may as well try to install/update most of the package we may use in the course now. Lets try to run the following (I would be surprised if this works for everybody in the first go):

```{r cran-installation, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages("tidyverse")
```

This will install the __core__ tidyverse packages:

* ggplot2, for data visualization.
* dplyr, for data manipulation.
* tidyr, for data tidying.
* readr, for data import.
* purrr, for functional programming.
* tibble, for "tibbles", a modern re-imagining of data frames.

`library(tidyverse)` will load the core tidyverse packages.

In addition, this also installs a selection of other tidyverse packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis. This includes packages for:

* Working with specific types of vectors:
    
    * lubridate, for date/times.
    * hms, for times.
    * stringr, for strings.
    * forcats, for factors.

* Importing other types of data:

    * DBI, for databases (..., this may create a problem)
    * haven, for SPSS, SAS and Stata files.
    * httr, for web apis.
    * [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroenooms/jsonlite) for JSON.
    * readxl, for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.
    * rvest, for web scraping.
    * xml2, for XML.

* Modelling

    * modelr, for modelling within a pipeline
    * [broom](https://github.com/dgrtwo/broom), for turning models into 
      tidy data

These packages you'll load explicitly with `library()`.

Additional packages will be install as we progress through the course.
