# Grammar of data

The tidyverse package, through the dplyr and tidyr, are a set of tools for a common set of problems connected to
aggregates or summaries of data.

* Similar to ggplot2 they feature a Domain Specific Language (DSL)
  specially designed for data summaries.
* Developed by Hadley Wickam, the creator ggplot2 and other
  useful tools.

Commonly, when collating summaries by group, one wants to:

* **Split** up a big data structure into homogeneous pieces,
* **Apply** a function to each piece
* **Combine** all the results back together.


![](img/split-apply-combine.png)


For example, one might want to

* fit the same model to different species
* quickly calculate summary statistics for by gear type
* perform group-wise transformations like scaling or standardizing

## dplyr

Essentially dplyr and tidyr offer a collection of simple but powerful commands (or verbs) that facilitate this split-apply-combined process:

* **filter**: keep rows matching criteria
* **select**: pick columns by name
* **arrange**: order the rows according to a variable
* **mutate**: add new variables
* **summarise**: reduce variables to values
* **group_by**: gives the group to apply the analysis functions to 

The structure of these commands is always the same:

* First argument is a data frame
* Always return a data frame
* Subsequent arguments say what to do with data frame
* (Never modify in place)
* It recognizes the columns of the data.frame as variables, that is only need to call `col.name` instead of `dat$col.name`



### Selecting rows from a data.frame
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/filter.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

When selecting rows from a data.frame there are two ways, filter according to a certain criterion or find specific rows. You can create a subset of the data using the `filter` command:
```{r}
## find all whales caught in 2005
d.2005 <-
  filter(d,year == 2005)
d.2005
```

and filter even further:
```{r}
## find all whales caught in 2005 in the Southern area
d.2005.south <-
  filter(d,year == 2005, area == 'South')
d.2005.south
```

Filter can use any logical statement:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
 a == b   ## a is equal to b
 a != b   ## a is not equal to b
 a > b    ## a is greater than b
 a >= b   ## a is greater or equal to b
 a < b    ## a is less than b
 a <= b   ## a is less or equal to b
 a & b    ## a and b
 a | b    ## a or b
 !a       ## not a
 is.na(a) ## is a equal to NA (missing)
 a %in% b ## what elements of column a are also in column b 
```

So to filter out all whales caught in 2006 and 2007 you can either do:
```{r}
d.20056 <- filter(d, year %in% c(2006, 2007))
```
or
```{r}
d.20056 <- filter(d,year > 2005,year < 2008)
```


A related function is the `slice` function, that simply filters the data by row number
```{r}
d.slice <- 
  slice(d,10) ## get the 10th row
d.slice
```

or a bit more complicated

```{r}
d.slice <- 
  slice(d,c(1,4:6,100)) ## 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th and the 100th row
d.slice
```

This can of course be accomplished with the base R `[]` operator:
```{r}
d[c(1,4:6,100),]
```

<div class="panel-body">

* Find all minke whales caught that did not have a maturity status
* Find all males caught in the northern area in 2006 and 2007

</div>
</div>

### Selecting columns

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/select.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


The `select` functions allows you to ask for certains columns:
```{r}
d.redux <- 
  select(d,id,year,maturity)
d.redux
```

You can also omit certain columns using negative indexing: for example you can select all columns except `area`:
```{r}
d.nar <- 
  select(d,-area)
d.nar
```

The `select` function can use a couple of fairly useful helper function:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
starts_with('stomach')  ## Finds all columns that start with "stomach"
ends_with('weight')     ## Finds all columns that end with "weight"
id:age       ## Finds all columns between "id" and "age"
contains('mach')      ## Finds all columns that contain "mach"
-date           ## Remove column "date" from the dataset
```

And you can of course combine these at will:
```{r}
d.redux <- 
  select(d,id:lat,starts_with('stomach'))
d.redux
```


`select` also allows you to rename columns as you select them:
```{r}
d.redux <- 
  select(d,id,date.caught=date)
d.redux
```

but this only selects the requested columns. If you just want to rename a couple of columns in the data frame leaving the other columns intact you can use the function `rename`:

```{r}
d.ren <- 
  rename(d,date.caught=date)
d.ren
```


<div class="panel panel-warning">
<div class="panel-heading">Exercise</div>
<div class="panel-body">

* Select age, length and id from the minke dataset, and rename id to "whale_id"
* Select the weight columns using the `contains` function

</div>
</div>

### Arranging rows
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/arrange.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


Arrange by date (in ascending order):
```{r}
d.arr <- arrange(d,date)
head(d.arr)
```

and in descending order:
```{r}
d.darr <- arrange(d,desc(date))
head(d.darr)
```

You can also arrange by more that one column:
```{r}
d.arr2 <- arrange(d,year,desc(stomach.volume))
head(d.arr2)
```



### Adding columns to data frames
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/mutate.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


Mutate allows you to add new columns to your data. Let's calculate the approximate weight
```{r}
d.wapp <- 
  mutate(d,computed_weight = 0.00001*length^3)
```

You can also do more than one "mutation":
```{r}
d.wapp <- 
  mutate(d,
         computed_weight = 0.00001*length^3,
         approx_weight = ifelse(is.na(weight),0.00001*length^3,weight))
head(d.wapp)
```

To make our lives a bit easier mutate can "remember" the last result:

```{r}
d.wapp <- 
  mutate(d,
         computed_weight = 0.00001*length^3,
         approx_weight = ifelse(is.na(weight),computed_weight,weight))
head(d.wapp)
```

</div>


### Summarising data frames

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/summarise.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Useful to create (not so) simple summaries of the data
```{r}
d.summ <- 
  summarise(d, 
            ml = mean(length,na.rm = TRUE),
            ma = mean(age,na.rm=TRUE))
d.summ
```


Useful helper function
```{r,eval=FALSE}
n()             ## counts the number of rows
n_distinct(x)   ## counts the number distinct values of x
first(x)        ## first value of x
last(x)         ## last value of x
nth(x,n)        ## nth value of x  
```

For example, if we want to calculate the number of fish caught, number of bait-types and fishing locations:

```{r}
d.summ2 <- 
  summarise(d,
            num_whales = n(),
            num_years = n_distinct(year))
d.summ2
```


<div class="panel panel-warning">
<div class="panel-heading">Exercise</div>
<div class="panel-body">

* How many females were caught in the Northern area
* Calculate the mean stomach volume and standard deviation of all whales caught

</div>
</div>


### Split data frame rows by columns
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/group_summarise.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


Summarize and mutate are somewhat useful on its own but become much more useful when combined with a `group_by` statement

* **group_by** Group data into rows with the same value of (a) particular variable(s)
* **ungroup** Remove grouping information from data frame

```{r}
d.group <- 
  group_by(d,maturity)
d.group
```

`summarise` respects the grouping:

```{r}
vital.stats <- 
  summarise(d.group,
            num_whales = n(),
            num_years = n_distinct(year))
vital.stats
```


# Reshape verbs

When importing data the bulk of our time goes into cleaning data in order for it be useful for further analysis. Here the guiding principle is to describe tools that allow you to transform "messy" datasets to a "tidy" dataset. A "tidy" dataset is of the form:

1. Each variable forms a column.
2. Each observation forms a row.
3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.

The `tidyr` package allows you to do many of the commonly post import data tidying jobs with relative ease. The main functions of the package include:

* **gather**: Gather columns into rows
* **spread**: Spread rows into columns
* **separate**: Separate one column into many
* **unite**: Unite several columns into one

### Wide to long format
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/gather.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Often data are arranged in a wide format, e.g measurements from different years are placed in the same row with columns indicating the year. The wide format is more readable to humans but for computations is often more appropriate to store the data in a long format. 
```{r}
vital.long <- 
  gather(vital.stats,statistic,value,c(num_whales,num_years))
vital.long
```

Note that the first argument is the name of the key, i.e. the variable created from the column names, the second argument is the name of the value column (the column the stores the actual values) and the third argument specifies the column you want to transform

You can also use negative indexing indicating that those columns should remain intact:
```{r}
gather(vital.stats,statistic, value, -maturity)
```


### Long to wide format
```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/spread.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

`spread` is the exact opposite of `gather`, i.e. takes the data from a long format to a wide format:

```{r}
d.gr <- group_by(d,year,sex)
d.summ <- summarise(d.gr,n=n())
d.sp <- spread(d.summ,year,n)
d.sp
```

<div class="panel panel-warning">
<div class="panel-heading">Exercise</div>
<div class="panel-body">

* Calculate how many whales where caught by year and area
* Spread the data such that the columns represent area and rows years.

</div>
</div>


### Splitting columns

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/separate.png")
grid.raster(img)
```

Often data is stored in a single column when they really should be stored in two or more columns. The `separate` function allows you to take a column and split it up by pattern:
```{r}
## separate the date column into year, month, day, hour, minute and second
d.sep <- 
  separate(d,date,c('y','m','d','h','m','s'))
d.sep
```

The `separate` function looks for all possible dividers (i.e. non alphanumeric characters) and uses those to divide the column. One must therefore be careful to specify the new columns correctly.

You can also specify the separation symbol explicitly:

```{r}
d.sep <- 
  separate(d,date,c('date','time_of_day'),sep=' ')
d.sep

```



### Uniting columns

```{r,width=150,echo=FALSE}
img <- readPNG("img/unite.png")
grid.raster(img)
```


Sometimes it is useful, i.e. for presentational purposes, to combine one or more columns into a single column. The `unite` function allows this and is the opposite of `separate`
```{r}
d.united <- 
  unite(d,ns_year,c(area,year), sep = ' - ')
d.united
```


# Combining verbs

In R one can apply functions to data repeatedly:
```{r}
d.summ <- 
  summarise(group_by(d,sex,year),n=n())
d.summ
```


All this quickly becomes cumbersome and hard to read, for example what does this do?

```{r,eval=FALSE}
spread(summarise(group_by(d,sex,year),n=n()),sex,n)
```

### The `%>%` operator

dplyr allows chaining of operators using the $\%>\%$ operator

```{r}
d %>%
  group_by(sex,year) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) 
```

This needs a bit of explaining. Noticed that the first argument is always missing. Instead of calling a function with `f(x,y)` you can do `x %>% f(y)`, that is "take x, then apply f with a setting y". This essentially means that `%>%` operator takes the stuff on the left and places it as the first argument to function on the right hand side. This get infinitely more useful when you start creating longer chains: 

```{r}
d %>%
  mutate(computed_weight = 0.00001*length^3,
         weight_approx = ifelse(!is.na(weight),weight,computed_weight),
         K = 100*weight*1000/length^3) %>% 
  group_by(sex,year) %>% 
  summarise(n=n(),
            ml=mean(length,na.rm=TRUE),
            sl=sd(length,na.rm=TRUE),
            mK = mean(K, na.rm=TRUE),
            sK = sd(K, na.rm=TRUE)) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```
The above can be read as "take data d, then split into groups by sex and year, then calculate the mean and standard deviation of length and K for each group, then arrange by year".

         K = 100*weight*1000/length^3) %>% 
  group_by(sex,maturity) %>% 
  summarise(n=n()) %>% 
  spread(sex,n)
