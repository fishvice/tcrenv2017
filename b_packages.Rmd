Your best source when it comes to learning the ins and outs of package generation is the book [R packages](https://github.com/fishvice/tcrenv2016.git).

Basically within R-studio the minimum needed is the following:

1. File > New Project > New Directory > R Package > type in package name.
2. Install the package `roxygen2` if you have not already done so.
3. Suggest you then do: Tools > Project Options ... and
<div style="width:300px; height=300px">
![options](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/screenshots/build-reload-opts-2.png)
</div>
4. Put some functions (scripts) you have created into the R-directory
5. Open the .R documents, click anywhere inside the function code and do: Code > Insert Roxygen Skeleton
6. Do: Build > Build and Reload

If the steps above go smoothly you should by the end of last command see that your library has been loaded into your current session.

Then when you want to use the functions in this package in any other r-project you simply to the usual:
```
library(mypackage)
```
