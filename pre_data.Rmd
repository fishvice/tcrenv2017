# Preamble
___
Load the required packages
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(readxl)
library(openxlsx)
```

Get the datasets and place the datasets in a folder called "data"
```{r,eval=FALSE}
dir.create('data')
download.file("http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/data/minke.csv",destfile = 'data/minke.csv')
download.file("http://www.hafro.is/~einarhj/data/example_excel.xlsx",destfile = 'data/example_excel.xlsx')
```

## About the data
The minke whale dataset contains biological measurements from 192 scientific catches of minke whales between the year 2003 and 2007. The data set contains the following fields:

* **whale.id**: Unique identifier for the whale
* **date.caught**: the date when the whales was caught
* **lat**: latitude
* **lon**: longitude
* **area**: Derived from location (North/South)
* **length**: length of the whale
* **weight**: weight of the whale
* **age**: age of the whale
* **sex**: Male or Female
* **maturity**: maturity status of the whale
* **stomach.volume**: volume (in liters) of the stomach content
* **stomach.weight**: weight of the stomach content
* **year**: the year when the whale was caught

The excel file has two data sets:
The assessment summary of cod in Icelandic waters from 2017, obtained from http://dt.hafogvatn.is/astand/2017/01_cod.html . The data set contains the following fields:

* **Year** 
* **Rec** Recruitment as 3-year-olds in millions
* **SSB**  spawning stock
* **B4+**  reference biomass
* **Landings** landings in tonnes
* **HR** harvest rate (landings/reference biomass)
* **Fbar** fishing mortality (average for ages 5–10)

The second data set is the No Ballast on Board data set obtained from www.greatlakeslessons.com

# Sources of data 
___
![](img/sources.png)

## Reading material
* http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-import.html

# Keyboard
___
one can simply enter data directly to the console
```{r}
weight <- c(1,5,3,2,6)
length <- c(10,17,14,12,18)
plot(length,weight)
```

or if you want a more structured entry one can :
```{r}
d <- data_frame(weight = c(1,5,3,2,6),
                length = c(10,17,14,12,18))
ggplot(d,aes(length,weight)) + geom_point()
```

R even has a built data entry window:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
dat <- data.frame(id=numeric(0), species=character(0),
                  length=numeric(0),age=numeric(0),
                  lat = numeric(0),lon=numeric(0))
dat <- edit(dat)
```

but this only creates variable in R that, unless saved, will disappear when R is closed.

### Saving R objects

R has a special file format for saving R objects, such as data frames, called Rdata files. To save an object to a file you can:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
save(d,file='d.Rdata')
```

where R saves the d data frame to a file called 'd.Rdata'. You can any number of objects to a file:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
save(d,length, weight, file = 'someData.Rdata')
```

If you want to save everything in your workspace you can also do:
```{r}
save.image(file='everything.Rdata')
```


# Text files
___
Text files are the most basic types of data files and commonly used in all data exchange. Most of the data that we are interested in is in some sort of tabular form and whole host of functions are available to import these files into R. These include the following functions from the `readr` package, included in the `tidyverse` package:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
read_csv  ## read comma separated files where the decimal is denoted as '.'
read_csv2 ## read comma separated files where the decimal is denoted as ','
read_tsv  ## read tab separated files
read_table ## read white space separated files 
read_delim ## read files with user specified delimination
```

These functions all have similar inputs where the settings of the data import can be tweaked:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
read_function(file,           ## location of the data file 
              skip=n,         ## how many lines at the top of the file should be discarded
              col_names=TRUE, ## should the first line be treated as column names
              comment = '#',  ## everything after the comment symbol will be ignored
              n_max=Inf)      ## maximum number of lines to read in
```

Note that `read_function` is a placeholder name for any of the `read_*` functions. For the most common cases only the file location is needed, which means if your data file is situated in your working directory this is just the name of the file:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_function('nameOfFile.txt')
```

But files can be stored anywhere on your computer, if the file is in a folder called data within the working directory:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_function('data/nameOfFile.txt')
```

If it is the folder that contains your working directory:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_function('../nameOfFile.txt')
```

And if it is somewhere on the computer one can use absolute positioning:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_function('~/Path/to/File/nameOfFile.txt')  ## linux/mac
d <- read_function('c:/Path/to/File/nameOfFile.txt') ## windows
```

R can even read files on-line:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
d <- read_function('http://somwhereontheweb.com/nameOfFile.txt')
```

Now reading in the minke whale dataset, assuming it is located in the working directory in a directory named "data", the data import is simply:

```{r}
minke <- 
  read_csv('data/minke.csv')
```

It is however useful to look at how one would use `read_delim` to import the same data file:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
minke <-
  read_delim(file = 'data/minke.csv', ## path to the file
             col_names = TRUE,        ## are column names
                                      ## at the top
             delim = ',',             ## column separator symbol
             skip = 0,                ## num lines at top to skip
             comment = '#')           ## indicating comments
```

```

</div>

### Useful sanity checks 

When importing data into R it is fairly useful to have the following in mind

* Does each variable have its own column and each subject it own line?
* Are there any unnecessary lines or columns?
* Do the data contain any non-US characters?
* Are there gaps in the data?
* Are the results entered consistently?
* Does every variable have its own name?
* Are the numbers correctly entered?
* Are there any items that can cause misunderstanding?

Any of these points can cause trouble when importing the data, in particular when the data has been prepared using Excel. Notably automatic date conversions in Excel is frequently the culprit for many data import issues. After importing is often useful to run a couple of tests on the data to ensure you have read the data in correctly:

The first six rows:
```{r}
head(minke)
```

last six rows
```{r}
tail(minke)
```

How many columns or rows are there in the data
```{r}
dim(minke)
```

What are the names of the column
```{r}
names(minke)
```

Summary statistics for the dataset
```{r}
summary(minke)
```

Structure of the data
```{r}
glimpse(minke)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
tmp <- read_table('data/minke.csv')

```

</div>
</div>


### Exporting data

R can also export data into formats readable by other software. Among these are:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
write_csv   # write a comma separated file
write_delim # write a file with user defined delimiter
write_tsv   # write a tab separated file
write_excel_csv  # write a comma separated file for Excel
write       # write a line to a file
```

Most used inputs to these functions are the object to be exported and the file name with the desired location. To export the minke data set as a comma separated file you can simply do:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
write_csv(minke,path = 'minke.csv')
```

but with a bit more control
```{r,eval=FALSE}
write_delim(minke,
            path = 'minke-class.csv',  ## file name
            col_names = TRUE,          ## write header
            delim = ',')               ## specifiy the delimiter

```

The `write_excel_csv` is nearly identical to `write_csv`, except it adds a hidden character at the top of the file that instructs Excel to read the file with "utf-8" (the universal character encoding).

You can write single lines to a file with the `write` function:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
write('Here is some text',file='Afile.txt')
```

But this becomes more useful when appending the text to an existing file:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
write('# comment describing the data', file = 'dataFile.csv')
write_csv(minke,path = 'dataFile.csv', append = TRUE, col_names = TRUE)
write('# other comment at the bottom', file = 'dataFile.csv',append = TRUE)

```

Be careful with append, if not properly set the file can be overwritten.


# Excel
___
### Importing Excel files
With the readxl package we can read Excel files directly into R with the `read_excel` function:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_excel(path,               # Path to the excel file
                sheet = NULL,       # What sheet should be read (either name or number)
                range = NULL,       # What cells should be read   
                skip = 0,           # how many lines a the top should be skipped
                col_names = TRUE,   # is the first line 
                col_types = 'guess')# what is the type of data in the column

```




In the simplest of cases where the data is well formed we can simply read the data in 
```{r}
icod_summary <- read_excel("data/example_excel.xlsx")
icod_summary
```

You can also list the sheets in the Excel file

```{r}
excel_sheets('data/example_excel.xlsx')
```
So if the data is in a specific sheet we can specifiy the sheet directly by name or number:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# by order
read_excel("data/example_excel.xlsx", sheet = 1) 
# by name
read_excel("data/example_excel.xlsx", sheet = 'iCod_summary') 

```
Excel file are notoriously free form so often data are mingled in with comments and colors. We can specify the columns and rows where the data are located within the sheet explicity with the range setting of `read_excel`:

```{r}
d <- read_excel('data/example_excel.xlsx',range = 'A1:D6')
d
```

And you can even specify the sheet in the range Excel-style:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
d <- read_excel('data/example_excel.xlsx',range = 'iCod_summary!A1:D6')
```

The `readxl` package provides also a couple of helper functions when specifing the range:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
anchored      # anchor selction to a specific cell
cell_cols     # read selected columns
cell_rows     # read selected roww
cell_limits   # read selected columns and rows
```

So you can ask for only the 3rd and the 4th column:
```{r}
read_excel('data/example_excel.xlsx',range = cell_cols(3:4))
```

When importing you can also explicitly define how the columns in your data will be determined using the col_types argument:
```{r}
read_excel('data/example_excel.xlsx',col_types = c('text','numeric','numeric','numeric','numeric','numeric','numeric'))
```

Available column types are: 

guess | numeric
----- | -------
text  | logical
date  | list
skip  | -

Note that when the data in the cells can't be coerced in the the desired format the cell contents will be replace with `NA`-s.

### Exporting to excel

Another package, `openxlsx`, provides tools to export data to an Excel format. To export a single data frame you can simply write:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
write.xlsx(minke,file='minke.xlsx')
```

If you need to export more that one data frame you can use a named list:
```{r,eval=FALSE}
write.xlsx(list(minke=minke,iCod=icod_summary),file='RtoExcel.xlsx')
```


# Other statistical software
___
Data is often stored in format created by other statistical software packages such a SPSS and SAS. The haven package provides the necessary functions to import and export to these file formats:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# SAS
read_sas    # read sas file
write_sas   # write sas file
# SPSS
read_sav    # read spss file
write_sav   # write spss file

# Stata
read_dta    # read stata file
write_dta   # write stata file
```

There are a number of SPSS/SAS/Stata features that have no direct equivalent in R. Haven preserves them so you can choose what do with them. To simply eliminate them, use one of the zap functions:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
as_factor     # Convert input to a factor.
labelled_spss # Labelled vectors for SPSS
labelled      # Create a labelled vector.
is.labelled   # -><- 
print_labels  # Print the labels of a labelled vector

tagged_na        # "Tagged" missing values
na_tag  
is_tagged_na 
format_tagged_na 
print_tagged_na

zap_empty     # Convert empty strings into missing values.
zap_formats   # Remove format attributes
zap_labels    # Zap labels
zap_missing   # Zap special missings to regular R missings
zap_widths    # Remove display width attributes
```


# Database connectivity
___
Databases are commonly used to store (large amounts of) data and numerous software vendors provide database solutions, both general and specific
Similarly numerous packages exist to interact with databases in R. Notably DBI, RODBC and dplyr.
Typically in an R session the user queries the database for the data needed for a particular analysis and loads it into memory. Larger datasets, that don’t fit into memory will need to be subsampled. The most common types of database engines have a specialised R package:

Engine  | R-package
------- | ---------
**Oracle**  | ROracle
**Postgres**  | RPostgreSQL
**MSSQL**   | odbc
**MySQL** | RMySQL
**sqlite**  | RSQLite

To illustrate how the database connectivity works we will set up a dummy sqlite database containing the minke dataset. The following command creates and sets up a link to a dummy database
```{r}
db <- src_sqlite('minke.db',create = TRUE)
```

It is fairly straightforward to add data to the database. Here the minke whale data is copied to a table called `minke_tbl`
```{r}
tmp <- copy_to(db,minke,'minke_tbl')
```

We can query the database in many ways. If we want everything from the table we use the `tbl` command:
```{r}
minke.tbl <- tbl(db,'minke_tbl')
minke.tbl
```

You can also run arbitrary sql commands:
```{r}
num.minke <- 
  tbl(db,sql('select count(1) from minke_tbl'))
num.minke
```


Describe the table
```{r}
tbl_vars(minke.tbl)
glimpse(minke.tbl)
```

List all tables in a database
```{r
db_list_tables(db$con)
```
